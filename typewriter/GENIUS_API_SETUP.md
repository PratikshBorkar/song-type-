To enhance your song search with the Genius API, follow these steps:

## 1. Get Your Genius API Access Token

1. Go to [Genius API Clients page](https://genius.com/api-clients)

4. Fill in your app details:
   - **App Name**: Lyric Playground

   - **Redirect URI**: http://localhost:5175 (can be anything for client-only apps)
5. Click "Save"
6. Click "Generate Access Token" to get your client access token

## 2. Add Your Token to the App

1. Open `src/services/lyricsAPI.js`
2. Find the line: `const GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN = null;`
3. Replace `null` with your token: `const GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your-token-here';`

## 4. Without API Token

The app works perfectly without a Genius token:

## 5. Current Implementation

The app now:
1. **Searches Genius API** for song metadata (if token available)
2. **Uses lyrics.ovh API** to fetch actual lyrics
3. **Falls back to sample lyrics** if both fail
4. **Provides rich search results** with artist and song info
5. **Supports international songs** with language detection

Your typing test is now powered by the industry-leading Genius database! ðŸŽµ
